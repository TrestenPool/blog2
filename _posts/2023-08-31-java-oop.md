<!------------------- OOP CONCEPTS -------------------->
<!----------------------------------------------------->

## OOP Concepts

### Encapsulation
  - Usually has 2 meanings in OOP
    1. Bundling of behavior and attributes on a single object
    2. The practice of hiding fields and methods from public access
  - Why would we want to hide things?
    - to make interface simplier
    - hide unnecessary details
    - protect integrity of data on an object

### Inheritance
  - ![alt-text](/2023-08-31-java-oop/inheritence.png)
  - Defines a **is a relationship**
  - As a form of code re-use
  - a way to organize classes into a parent-child hierarchy, which lets the child inherit (re-use), fields, methods from it's parent
  - **A CHILD CAN ONLY HAVE 1 DIRECT PARENT THAT IT INHERITS FROM IN JAVA**

### Polymorphism
  - simply means many forms
  - makes code simpler
  - it encourages code extensibility

### Composition
  - defines a **has a relationship**
  - more flexible than inheritence
    - you can add and remove composition components without the risk of breaking all of the subclasses that are inherited from like inheritence
