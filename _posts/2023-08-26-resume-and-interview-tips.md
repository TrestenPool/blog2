# Resume Tips
  - Things to Note
    - Don't be too creative
      - reason being is that the interviewer goes through multiple resumes a day and they should all be the same format to make it easy for them to read and assess

    - Don't be afraid to list your accomplishments 
      - Feel free to list your teams accomplishments because they are important but also include some things that you did to improve technology or business imacts
    
    - Don't just list your responsiblities but use the STAR method instead
